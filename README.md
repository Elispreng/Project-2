# Data Science and American Middle Class
## Anazlyzing US Incomes Greater and Less Than 50K

**Eli Spreng**: 

### Topic:

This dataset looks at US residents who make more or less than fifty thousand dollars, a benchmark for lower middle class life. Interested parties may wonder what is
/are the most significant facors for entry into US middle class. 

### Data:
Adult Income Datat Set: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset]


## Methods
- To perform this analysis the data was cleaned and then exploratory and explanatory visuals offer insights
- Machine learning using classification metrics provides another way to understand the income group. 

## Results

#### Visual 1: Bar Graph Showing Outlet Year and Sales

The graph addresses answers the question "What year has the highest item  sales?" The highest item sales were in 2004.

This bar graph answers the question "What  year has the tighest MRP?" The highest MRP was in 2004

## Machine learning and metrics
- Baseline Model
- Logistic Regression Model
- Random Forest Model

### Linear Regression Metrics:

- Model Training R2: 0.6714424977432687

### Decision Tree Model Train Scores
 - MAE: 0.0 
 - MSE: 0.0
 - RMSE: 0.0 
 - R2: 1.0

### Decision Tree Model Test Scores
 - MAE: 992.5956 
 - MSE: 2103175.480
 - RMSE: 1450.2329
 - R2: 0.2376974

### Bagged Trees Model Train Scores
 -  MAE: 316.5676
 -  MSE: 240010.0091
 -  RMSE: 489.9082
 -  R2: 0.9189006

### Bagged Trees Model Test Scores
 - MAE: 785.6302
 - MSE: 1279423.2806
 - RMSE: 1131.1159
 - R2: 0.536269

## Recommendations:

From these metrics, the random forest model is the best model with the lowest error and highest R2. However, there is still some variance in this model. 

## Limitations & Next Steps

This project will include more graphics. Another limitation is the dataset which does not match US Census statistics.
